# port-scanner
Simple Python2 port scanner

I will update this to Python3 at some point (unless somebody wants to do that...)

The regular file shows all ports being scanned, whereas the "no confirmation" file only shows open ports that are found.
I personally prefer the first one as I like to watch the progress.

Any feedback on this would be great, some of the socket commands came from a connection tutorial that I modified to fit my needs. Unfortunately I do not remember what the tutorial was called.
